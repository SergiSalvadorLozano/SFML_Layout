v1.0.1

GENERAL

- Changed ALIGNMENT and DRAWMODE constants from 'int' to dedicated 'enum' types (with those same names). They are no longer declared in their own namespace.

EXAMPLE

- Changed texture paths for assets from Windows style to Unix style (which works on Windows, too). It's no longer necessary to change them depending on the system.
