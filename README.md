SFML_Layout
===========

C++ classes expanding the basic functionality of SFML in order to ease the process of building and managing layout-based UIs.

===========

This repository contains the following files:

----------

* layout.hpp
* layout.cpp

This part of the code corresponds to the base classes containing most of the logic and functionality independent from specific graphic libraries.

----------

* SFMLLayout.hpp
* SFMLLayout.cpp

This part of the code corresponds to those classes reliant on components imported from SFML.

----------

* example.cpp

This program is intended to illustrate the usage of some of the classes and methods implemented in the 'SFML_Layout' libraries.

----------

* Assets/*

This folder contains a series of image files used as textures by 'example.cpp'.

----------
